            <h1>Facility Considerations</h1>
                <p>In each Let's Potato Chip facility, allergen information is handled through strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination and ensure safety. Raw ingredients are carefully identified and stored separately, with detailed allergen information from suppliers. Cleaning procedures are followed between production runs to avoid cross-contact. Employees receive training on allergen awareness and proper handling. Finished products are clearly labeled with allergen information, and packaging lines are dedicated to either allergen-free or allergen-containing products. Detailed records are kept for traceability, ensuring quick identification of affected products in case of a recall.</p>

            <h1>Allergen Information</h1>
            <p>Potato chip ingredients may contain common allergens like dairy, gluten, soy, or trace amounts of nuts, depending on the flavor or processing method. It's essential to check the ingredient list and allergen warnings on packaging, as cross-contamination can occur in facilities that process multiple products. Manufacturers provide clear allergen labeling to help consumers avoid potential risks.</p>
